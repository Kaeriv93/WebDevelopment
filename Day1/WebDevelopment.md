# So what is Web Development?
You guys are probably wondering just what is **Web Development**? Well to answer your question, we need to ask ourselves what is the internet and how exactly does it work.
In short, the internet is the backbone of the web. It is essentially a large network of computers that communicate altogether. What we will focus on this course is how to build our very own webpage. Now the basic webpage will consist of three items.

## HTML
HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. This is currently the backbones of our webpage. HTML, will consist of different blocks of text that helps build out the page! This will include things such as a navigation bar, links to a new page, tables and forms. Don't worry if it's not making too much sense, we will definitely dive into it much deeper as we progress!

## CSS
Cascade Styling Sheets, will help us style our page. This will include everything from changing your font size, the background color, and various other things. Imagine that in a human body, the HTML will be the skeleton and body of a person, while the CSS will be the clothes that we wear! Again if it's not making sense we will spend a lot of time on this moving forward.

## JAVASCRIPT
Javascript is a programming language. The beautiful thing about Javascript, is that we can use it for both Frontend Development or Backend Development. It is a high level language, that is easy to pick up! Now please note **JAVASCRIPT** is not the same as **JAVA**. Although they may have similiar names, they are completely different from one another. Javascript is used to give behaviors to our website. These can include things such as clicking buttons, submitting forms, anything that has to do with interaction. Now do keep in mind, Javascript will definitely be the hardest of the three to pick up. But everything will come with practice! As long as you keep at it, it will get easier.

# Words of Encouragement 
Web Development will be meant to challenge you and at times you may want to give up. And that's an okay feeling, if this job was easy then everyone will be a developer! But you are here because you want to make a difference and that's awesome! Please feel free to reach out to me for any debugging. This course will not teach you everything, but provide you the building blocks needed to help you learn the fundamentals. I will list a few resources down below that will help you with you learning!
