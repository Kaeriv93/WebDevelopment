# Day 1

## Setting Up Our Environment
Hello Developers! I will be walking you all through how to set up your environment! Please take note of which operating system that you will be using! I will be posting videos down below for those that will be working with either Mac or Windows. As of now, I will not be touching on Linux systems, so sorry about that!

### Downloading Visual Code
[Visual Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
Please follow the directions on how to download for either Windows or Mac.
Visual Studio Code will be the primarily IDE(integrated development environment) that we work with. Please feel free to use whichever IDE, that you are comfortable with. An IDE is a special text editor that allows our computer to compile our code to run a program or app! 

If you guys get stuck please refer to these videos!

Github is a place where you will be able to store all of your projects. This will be your online presence and I will be hosting videos and tutorials, moving forward! In the coming days, I will be leading you all on how to clone everything into your machine so that you can follow along!
