# Intro to CSS

So what exactly is CSS? If the HTML was the building blocks of our app, then css will be the style of how it looks! CSS or Cascade Styling Sheets, NOT Cambodian Student Society, is the styling of a webpage. In here we can edit the colors, the font size of a few different things, or center align things. If you can think it, we basically can do it!

## CSS Syntax

So earlier we talked a bit about what HTML tags were? Well in order for us to style any part of our HTML page, we will have to **select** the tag.

What do you mean by this?

For example when if we had an h1 tag and wanted to style it we'd have to select the tag in our style sheet.

In this styling sheet(don't worry about using vs code if you're not comfortable we can have a play around in code pen again)
